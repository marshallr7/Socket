Hello there ('50.27.44.119', 58350). Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a good idea it takes about 1 minute and five lines to program something that almost does what you want. Then it takes only an hour to extend the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you want., Jack Jansen, 8 Jul 1992
