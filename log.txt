Hello there ('50.27.44.119', 58743). Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:We will perhaps eventually be writing only small modules which are identified by name as they are used to build larger ones, so that devices like indentation, rather than delimiters, might become feasible for expressing local structure in the source language.
