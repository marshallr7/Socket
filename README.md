# Socket

This is a simple program made for Texas Tech University CS 4392 Project 1. It takes user input and connects to the server they define.


# Installation and Execution
To install this program, you can clone or download it from the GitHub repository (). Once installed, open your terminal and navigate to the installation folder. Once there, run `Python3 main.py`.

# Utilization
After you run the program, to use it, enter the IP and port from your server, then your local log file in the following format: `client -s {IP} -p {PORT} -l {LOG_FILE}`. If the log file is not found, it will create and use the backup log file (file.txt), which will be located in your project directory.
